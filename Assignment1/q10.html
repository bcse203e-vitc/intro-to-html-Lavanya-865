        <p>Web programming involves creating and maintaining websites and web applications. 
            It includes writing code for client-side (front-end) and server-side (back-end) 
            functionality using technologies like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and server-side 
            languages such as Python, PHP, or Node.js. Web programming enables interactive, 
            responsive, and dynamic online experiences.</p>
